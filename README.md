Emerging system architectures and tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a thermostat controlled by the two buttons on my TI microcontroller board. It allows the user to set a temperature using the buttons on the side and then adjusts the temp accordingly.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like I did a good job of breaking up the program into smaller manageable parts that helped me nail down the flow of the program. This allowed me to write code in a good logical order that is easier to debug.

Where could you improve?

While I did a good job of nailing down the flow of the program I feel like I could have done better transferring it into code.

What tools/resources are you adding to your support network?

During this class I learned alot about embedded systems and how to program and control them. This is very different from the rest of my classes and I enjoyed it alot! It was good to actually code in a new language that I havent used yet.

What skills from this project will be transferable to other projects or course work.

The skills I gained include the ability to think throught the flow of a project more effieciently and how to plan larger projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.

I used best coding practices, commented my code, and made my variable names descriptive to allow for more readability.
